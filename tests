I will create the following test files within the `tests` directory:

1. `test_module1.py`: This file will contain unit tests for the functionalities provided by `module1`. It will import the necessary functions and classes from `module1` and define test functions to cover different scenarios.

2. `test_module2.py`: Similarly, this file will contain unit tests for the functionalities provided by `module2`. It will import the necessary functions and classes from `module2` and define test functions to cover different scenarios.

3. `test_integration.py`: This file will contain integration tests that test the interaction between different modules or components of the codebase. It will import the necessary functions and classes from multiple modules and define test functions to cover different integration scenarios.

4. `test_edge_cases.py`: This file will focus on testing edge cases and boundary conditions. It will define test functions that cover scenarios where inputs are at the extreme ends of the allowed range or where unexpected inputs are provided.

Each test file will have multiple test functions, each targeting a specific functionality or scenario. The test functions will use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the code and compare it with the actual output.
