The contents of the updated `github/workflows/main.yml` file will depend on the specific modifications needed to fix the failing run. Since the exact details of the failing run and the modifications required are not provided, I cannot provide the specific contents of the updated file.

Please provide more information about the specific error logs or any available information related to the failing run, and I will be able to assist you further in updating the GitHub Actions workflow file.
