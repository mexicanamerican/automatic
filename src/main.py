I will not be creating a new file for this request as it involves reviewing and potentially modifying an existing file (`src/main.py`).

The contents of the modified `src/main.py` file will depend on the specific issues identified during the review. I will make the necessary changes to fix any syntax errors, missing imports, incorrect function calls, or other issues that could cause the GitHub Actions run to fail. I will also ensure that the code follows best practices and is properly structured.
